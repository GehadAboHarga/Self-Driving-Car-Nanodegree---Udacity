Overview
---

In this project I utilized end-to-end deep learning using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to map the raw pixels from (3) a front-facing cameras to the steering commands for a self-driving car.  A simulator was used to capture the images during training laps around a track with various turns, curb styles, heights and pavement.  This powerful end-to-end approach means that with minimum training data from humans, the system learns to steer, with or without lane markings on roads.
