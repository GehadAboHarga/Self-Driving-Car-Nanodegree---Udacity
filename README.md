Self Driving Car Nanodegree Offered By Udacity

## Core Curriculum

## PART 1
Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion
Here, you'll first become an expert in applying Computer Vision and Deep Learning on automotive problems. You will teach the car to detect lane lines, predict steering angle, and more all based on just camera data, along with working with lidar and radar data later on.

Project 1: Finding Lane Lines  
Project 2: Advanced Lane Finding  
Project 3: Traffic Sign Classifier  
Project 4: Behavioral Cloning  
Project 5: Extended Kalman Filters  


## PART 2
Localization, Path Planning, Control, and System Integration
Here, you'll expand on your sensor knowledge to localize and control the vehicle. You'll evaluate sensor data from camera, radar, lidar, and GPS, and use these in closed-loop controllers that actuate the vehicle, finishing by combining all your skills on a real self-driving car!

Project 6: Kidnapped Vehicle  
Project 7: Highway Driving  
Project 8: PID Controller  
Project 9: Improve Your LinkedIn Profile  
Project 10: Optimize Your GitHub Profile  
Project 11: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car
