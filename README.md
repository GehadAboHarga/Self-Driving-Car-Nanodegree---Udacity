Nanodegree applying computer vision and deep learning to automotive problems, including detecting lane lines, predicting steering angles, and more. Next, you'll learn sensor fusion, which you'll use to filter data from an array of sensors in order to perceive the environment. The capstone of the entire Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program We’ll introduce Carla, the Udacity self-driving car, and the Robot Operating System that controls her. You’ll work to combine what you’ve learned over the course of the entire Nanodegree Program to run your code on a virtual version of Carla, a real self-driving car.  
    
PART 1  
Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion  
Here, you'll first become an expert in applying Computer Vision and Deep Learning on automotive problems. You will teach the car to detect lane lines, predict steering angle, and more all based on just camera data, along with working with lidar and radar data later on.

Project: Behavioral Cloning  
Project: Extended Kalman Filters  
  
PART 2  
Localization, Path Planning, Control, and System Integration  
Here, you'll expand on your sensor knowledge to localize and control the vehicle. You'll evaluate sensor data from camera, radar, lidar, and GPS, and use these in closed-loop controllers that actuate the vehicle, finishing by combining all your skills on a real self-driving car!
